# K-Nearest_Neighbours
 Supervised KNN Classification algorithm

K-Nearest-Neighbours is used to classify data based on its proximity to similar data points.
This program takes a data set of customer information. The set includes personal information and a customer
category 1,2,3 or 4 for the type of service that they recieve.
Based on the personal information, the K-NN algorithm will try to guess which service should be suggested to a
new customer.
